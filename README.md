# SimpleMazeSolver

A Simple Maze Solver in C++

This repository contains a simple maze solver implemented in C++. The program aims to solve mazes by finding a path from the starting point to the destination using various algorithms.

Key Features:

- Implements popular maze-solving algorithms, including depth-first search (DFS).
- accepts input from the user to create the maze graph.
- Provides visualization of the maze-solving process for better understanding and debugging.
- Draws the final path from the beginning point  to the final point.
  
This maze solver project serves as a learning resource for understanding algorithmic problem-solving, graph traversal, and basic file handling in C++.

Feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or use this repository to learn and experiment with maze-solving algorithms in C++. Let's navigate through mazes together!


- you can download the .exe file from the folder called mazeSolverEXE

- How to use
- you should first map the maze paths to a graph
- you can add a vertex somewhere by pressing v + the left mouse button
- you can delete a vertex (v + right mouse button)
- you can add an edge between 2 vertices by selecting any 2 vertices and pressing "E" button
- you can delete edge (E + right mouse button)
- to start the solver press "S" button 
- to reset Press "R" button

- notice that the solver will try to find a path between the first and the last vertex you add to the maze
